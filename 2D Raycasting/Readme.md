This is a basic custom Ray tracer for Unity.
It Uses a custum Rendering Pipeline.
Current known Issues:
Buffers sometimes do not get properly cleared resulting in displaying geometry that has been destroyed / disabled.


Setup:
Download SRP from Unity Github.
I used Unity 2020.1.16f and the latest srp 8.xx, I can not assure that older or later versions are compatible.
